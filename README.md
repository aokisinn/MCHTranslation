#	How-To: Translate My Crypto Heroes!

**[IMPORTANT:
BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO MAKE A TRANSLATION, CHECK THE "Issues" and "Pull requests" TAB ABOVE,
TO SEE IF SOMEONE ELSE IS ALREADY WORKING ON IT.
If so, maybe you can collaborate!
And if no one else is, PLEASE CREATE A NEW ISSUE in this repo
so that others know you're working on it!]**


**Step 1)** Fork or download this repo 
(if you're forking it, be sure to make sure *your* repo is on a branch called `gh-pages`, so that GitHub can automatically generate a webpage for it!)

**Step 2)** Translate files.
If you add a new language, please name the file according to ISO-639-1. You can check your language code  [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).
For example, the Chinese translation file should be "zh.json".
If there are some sentences that you can not translate, you can skip them!

**Step 3)** Remember to test your translation! You can test things locally using [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/).

**Step 4)** Create Pull Request! 

**Step 5)** Wait for merging

**Step 6)** Party! ðŸŽ‰
